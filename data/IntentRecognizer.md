# Embedded Intent Recognizer

## Build a simple small intent recognition command line tool.

The idea is to be able to ask a set of predefined questions and accurately recognize the intent of the user. The predefined intents are the following:

* What is the weather like today? => Prints (Intent: Get Weather)
* What is the weather like in Paris today? => Prints (Intent: Get Weather City)
* What is the weather like in New York today? => Prints (Intent: Get Weather City)
* Am I free at 13:00 PM tomorrow? ==> Prints (Intent: Check calendar)
* Tell me an interesting fact. => Prints (Intent: Get Fact)
